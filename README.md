## Getting Started

Create a clone by clicking the green 'Code' button near the top of the GitHub repository page (Optionally, you can also fork the repository). Then open your terminal and paste `git clone` along with the HTTPS link to have the app's code on your local machine. Follow by using `cd` and the name of the cloned folder to move inside of it, and then use `code .` which will select open all files in the folder in Visual Studio Code. We've written a lot of comments to make it easier to understand the application's logic, and how you can change parts of the code to make the task planner behave how you like.

### Prerequisites

Install Git and Node.js on your system to send/receive files between repositories and to use the Mocha and Chai dependencies.

## Running the tests

Coding tests performed with regular `console.log()`s, and using Mocha & Chai.
