## Getting Started

Create a clone by forking or clicking the green button here on GitHub. Then open your terminal and paste `git clone` and the https link to have it on your local machine. Follow by using `cd` and the name of the folder to move inside of it and then use `code .` which will select all files in the folder and open them in your IDE like for example Visual Studio code. We've written a lot of comments to be able to understand our logic and how you can change parts of the code to make the task planner how you like.
